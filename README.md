# Biodiversity Analysis in National Parks

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, with a focus on species observed across different national park locations. The analysis looks at species types, conservation status, and observation patterns to better understand biodiversity trends.

This project involves scoping the problem, cleaning and preparing the data, analyzing key attributes, creating visualizations, and explaining the findings in a clear and practical way.

## Key Questions

This project aims to answer the following questions:

* What is the distribution of conservation status among species?
* Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
* Are the differences between species categories and conservation status statistically significant?
* Which species are most commonly observed, and how are they distributed across parks?

## Data Sources

The dataset used in this project includes two CSV files:

* `observations.csv`: Contains records of species observations across national parks
* `species_info.csv`: Contains species details such as category, scientific name, and conservation status

The datasets used in this project were provided by Codecademy and are inspired by real-world biodiversity data from the U.S. National Park Service. While the structure reflects real NPS data, the values have been simplified for educational purposes. To know more, feel free to visit the [website](https://irma.nps.gov/NPSpecies/).

## Tools and Libraries

The following tools and libraries were used in this project:

* Python
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## Key Outcomes

* Identified the distribution of conservation statuses across species
* Analyzed which species categories are more likely to be endangered
* Compared biodiversity richness across multiple national parks
* Highlighted the most and least observed species in each park
* Used visualizations to clearly communicate biodiversity trends

## Next Steps

Possible extensions of this project include:

* Deeper statistical testing on species and conservation status relationships
* Trend analysis across time if temporal data becomes available
* Park-level conservation priority scoring
* More advanced visualizations or interactive dashboards
